# Lab 5 Simple Concurrency

This repository contains both the tasks and their solutions.
The version given to students will *obviously* not contain the solutions.

Some things may still be WIP, but they will be finished in due time.

## Instructions

1. Get the files.
2. Do the tasks.

Also,

- Files in the "readonly" folder **should not** be modified.
- Files in the "tasks" folder **should** be modified, indicated by "`// TODO`".
- `#include`s **should not** be modifed. You have everything you need.
